This README gives insight to the details of this program and how to interpret it.

The first portion of this program highlights random state values with the generate_next_state function. This function takes a current state and a random number from 0 to 1. Using this current state and random number, we generate the next state.

The program then prints out the first 40 states using the generate_next_state function. After this, the proportion of states is calculated and printed to the console.

Lastly, I compare my results with fixed variables compared to a truly random application with code. This was a homework problem that students completed in class with fixed values, while this code uses true random variables to determine the next state.
